notes:
  - Equivalent full-time students (EFTS) are the main unit of measure of the consumption of education (with one student enrolled in a standard programme of study full-time for the full year equating to 1.0 EFTS).
  - Standard training measure (STM) is the main unit of measurement of the consumption of training (one STM equals the amount of training required to achieve 120 register credits).
  - Levels of study refer to ‘qualification types’ as set out in the New Zealand Qualifications Framework. Levels are based on complexity, with level 1 the least complex and level 10 the most complex.
