notes:
    - The NEET rate is the total number of youth (aged 15 to 24 years) who are not in education, employment, or training, as a percentage of the total youth working-age population. Data may be suppressed for some regions in some years. NEET rates for Nelson-Tasman-Marlborough-West Coast are for the combined region, as are NEET rates for Gisborne-Hawke's Bay. These are annual average figures.  Results are subject to large sample errors, especially in smaller regions.
