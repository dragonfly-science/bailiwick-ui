notes:  
  - Data for regions (including TAs) has been derived from a mix of student-related indicators such as secondary school location, postcode of student's term or permanent address, and provider delivery site. Numbers should be taken as indicative only.
  - Ethnicity is self-reported and where students identify with more than one ethnicity they will be counted more than once. Students not reporting an ethnicity are not counted.
  - MELAA refers to Middle-Eastern, Latin American or African ethnicity.
