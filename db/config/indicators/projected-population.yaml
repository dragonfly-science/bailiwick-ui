notes:
  - Statistics New Zealand produces subnational population projections, to give an indication of the future population usually living in New Zealand regions, and territorial and unitary authority areas. Three projections (low, medium, and high growth) incorporating different fertility, mortality, and migration assumptions for each geographic area are produced to illustrate a range of possible scenarios. The data shown here are the medium growth projections.
